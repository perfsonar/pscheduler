		       pSchduler Limit Examples

This directory contains a number of examples that highlights how to
use one of the identifier or limit types provided by the pScheduler limit
system.

These files are examples only and should not be deployed used on
production systems.

Pairs in these files having names beginning with a pound sign ('#')
are treated as comments.  This behavior is not part of ECMA-404, the
JSON standard, and is peculiar to all JSON read by pScheduler.
