/*
 * Kluge to support multilib installation of both 32- and 64-bit RPMS:
 * we need to arrange that header files that appear in both RPMs are
 * identical.  Hence, this file is architecture-independent and calls
 * in an arch-dependent file that will appear in just one RPM.
 *
 * To avoid breaking arches not explicitly supported by Red Hat, we
 * use this indirection file *only* on known multilib arches.
 *
 * Note: this may well fail if user tries to use gcc's -I- option.
 * But that option is deprecated anyway.
