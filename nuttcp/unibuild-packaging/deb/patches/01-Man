 There are two basic modes of operation for nuttcp.  The original or
 classic mode is the transmitter/receiver mode, which is also the way
 the original ttcp and nttcp worked.  In this mode, a receiver is first

+transmitter must be started on the source host using "nuttcp \-t".
 This mode is somewhat deprecated and is no longer recommended for
 general use.  The preferred and recommended mode of operation for
 nuttcp is the new client/server mode.  With this mode, a server is

 the information provided by nuttcp is reported by the client, including
 the information from the server, thus providing a full snapshot of both
 the transmitter and receiver ends of the data transfer.
