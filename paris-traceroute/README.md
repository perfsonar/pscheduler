# Note about Paris Traceroute

This is version 0.9 of Paris Traceroute.  It was mistakenly packaged
for Red Hat as 1.0 because the source tarball the developers had did
not have a version associated with it.

The Debian version (built only on 11 or later because it was dropped)
patches the source and repeats this mistake for the sake of
consistency.
