# NOTE: This is something of a hack because it forces installation of
# all packages that are likely to be used.  It's necessary because
# pg_upgrade will refuse to work if required libraries are absent.

# NOTE: It would be nice if this version could obsolete older packages
# so they're uninstalled.  There's a conflict with packages that
# haven't been upgraded yet and still depend on the old one, so the
# best thing that can be done is disabling the older one and enabling
# the newer one.

Installing this package initializes the PostgreSQL server, upgrades
the data from and disables any previous versions, starts it and makes
