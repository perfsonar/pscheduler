\section{Developing for pScheduler}

This guide provides the information required to build software modules
that add to pScheduler's capabilities.

\part{The pScheduler Plug-In Architecture}

As its name hints, pScheduler's job is to do five things, all of which
center around making measurements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Accept tasking from the outside.
\item Maintain a schedule of one or more times when the tasking should
  be carried out.  These events are called {\it runs}.
\item Carry out the tasking by executing the scheduled runs.
\item Receive run results.
\item Distribute the results to archives for processing and long-term
  storage.
\end{enumerate}

One of the key tenets of pScheduler's design is that it should have no
understanding of the measurements it schedules or the programs which
to carry them out.  This is accomplished through abstraction and a
system of plug-ins which can be installed in any combination on a
perfSONAR system.  By using plug-ins, perfSONAR's capabilities can be
expanded by its user community without having to rely on the core
development team's limited resrouces.  Software to handle measurements
not of broad enough interest to be part of the mainstream perfSONAR
distribution can be developed and maintained by those who need them.

In order to make this happen, pScheduler establishes three classes of
things with which it can interface:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Tests}, which are abstract descriptions of a measurement to
  be made and the results.
\item {\it Tools}, which are programs which, in single or multiple
  instances working together, make a measurement specified by a test.
\item {\it Contexts}, which alter the execution context of tools
  before they are run.
\item {\it Archivers}, which send test results produced by tools
  elsewhere for long-term storage.
\end{itemize}

Each of these will be described in more detail in later sections.

\section{Concept of Operation}

\todo{Introductory paragraph}

This is the lifecycle of a measurement:

\begin{enumerate}
\item On startup, pScheduler inventories the installed tests, tools
  and archivers.  For tools, this includes getting information on
  which tests they run.
\item A task, consisting of a test specification, scheduling,
  archiving and other administrative information is written and
  provided to pScheduler.
\item The test specfication is validated by the test whose type is
  specified in the task.
\item The test specification is given to the test, which uses it to
  determine the list of nodes that will be participating.
\item pScheduler provides the test to each of the participants and is
  returned a list of the tools which are able and willing to carry out
  the test in order of preference.
\item The lead participant combs through the lists and selects a tool
  to be used for runs of the task.
\item The task is registered with each of the participants.
\item One or more runs of the task are scheduled.  As part of the
  scheduling process, the tool on each participant generates
  participant-specific data for that run, such as ports to be used.
\item The participant-specific data is collected, merged and
  distributed to all participants.
\item At the scheduled time, the measurement is performed, optionally
  with any specified context changes.  This produces a result which is
  stored locally by each participant.
\item The lead participant retrieves and stores the other
  participants' results.
\item The set of participant results are merged into a full result,
  which is stored by the lead participant.
\item The lead participant puts the results in a queue to be archived.
\item The results are sent to the specified archives, repeatedly if
  necessary because of failures.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Plug-In Concepts}

\subsection{Classes}

At the top level of the API are {\it classes}, each of which defines
an entity pScheduler requires to function.

There are three defined classes, which are the three items described
earlier (tests, tools and archivers).

\subsection{Methods}

Each class defines one or more {\it methods}, which carry out
functions specific to that class.

Methods are invoked across a process boundary (i.e., by running
programs external to pScheduler).  This almost completely decouples
pScheduler's technology stack from those of the components, providing
several benefits:

\begin{itemize}
\item Developers are free to select the right tool for the job 

developers to select the right tool for the job and allowing
significant evolution of one part without requiring the same of the
others.
\end{itemize}

Each method program will:

\begin{itemize}
\item Be installed in a defined location.
\item Have a defined name based on its function.
\item Accept input in a defined format.  For most programs, this will
  be JSON data.
\item Provide output on the standard output stream in a defined
  format.  For most programs, this will be JSON data.
\item Provide error output on the standard error stream as plain,
  human-readable text.
\item Exit with one of several defined status values, usually
  following the \true/\false\ convention or using values in
  the \headerfile{sysexits.h} header found on many systems.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Implementations}
\todo{Write this.  (What was I going to put in this section?)}


\subsection{Directory Structure}

\note{This information is provided as background and should not be
  used in determining where files should be installed.  Specific
  instructions for use with the standard packaging systems for various
  OS distributions can be found later in this document.}

Generally, pScheduler's installation of files follows the conventions
put forth in the {\it Filesystem Hierarchy Standard}
(\url{http://www.pathname.com/fhs}).

A typical directory tree on a system with several tests, tools and
archivers installed might look like this:

\dirtree{%
.1 /usr.
.2 libexec.
.3 pscheduler.
.4 classes $\odot$.
.5 test $\odot$ {\it Implementations of tests}.
.6 idle.
.6 rtt.
.5 tool $\odot$ {\it Implementations of tools}.
.6 sleep.
.6 snooze.
.6 ping.
.6 owping.
.5 archiver $\odot$ {\it Implementations of archivers}.
.6 bitbucket.
.6 esmond.
.2 share.
.3 doc.
.4 pscheduler.
.5 test $\odot$ {\it Test documentation}.
.5 tool $\odot$ {\it Tool documentation}.
.5 archiver $\odot$ {\it Archiver documentation}.
}

The full paths of directories marked with the symbol $\odot$ should be
provided as macros for packaging system specifications to use in
ensuring correct placement of installed files.

\todo{Should we specify the name of a directory inside each
  test/tool/archiver where private code can live?  (Thinking about
  common JSON validator modules which would to be used for tool {\tt
    can-run} and {\tt run} methods.)  {\tt PRIVATE} might be a good
  candidate.}

\section{Plug-In Classes}

\todo{Need to add a ``Command Line Arguments'' item to the description
  of each method.}

\todo{Change the ``Exit Status'' sections to be enumerated so they're easier to read.}

%
% TEST
%
\subsection{Test}

\todo{Introductory material}

\todo{Design of Tests}

\todo{Work this in somewhere: Tests are not necessarily restricted to
  the subset of parameters the tools which implement it have in
  common, rather they should be the superset of all parameters.  This
  makes it possible to use tool-unique features without requiring that
  every tool understand every parameter.  Tools will seeing tests
  containing parameters they do not understand or are outside of their
  abilities will simply decline to perform them.}

\todo{Test Specification}

The specification for a round-trip time test might look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
  "schema": 1,
  "source": null,
  "target": "somehost.example.org",
  "duration": "PT20S",
  "interval": "PT3S",
  "size": 1024,
  "ttl": 100,
  "tos": "0x5a"
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}



Every test must implement the methods listed in the following sections.

The directory tree of a test implementation would look like this ({\tt
  *} denotes an executable file):
\dirtree{%
.1 /usr/libexec/pscheduler/classes/test.
.2 {\itt test-name}.
.3 cli-to-spec*.
.3 enumerate*.
.3 participants*.
.3 result-format*.
.3 result-is-valid*.
.3 spec-is-valid*.
.3 spec-to-cli*.
}


\todo{Put these in alphabetical order.}

\subsubsection{enumerate}

This method produces a description of the test in a standard format
used when pScheduler needs to determine what tests are installed.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} Ignored.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} JSON containing the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt name} - A string serving as a short name for the test.  This
  value should be lowercase and match the name of the directory where
  the test class is installed.  Test names should be industry-standard
  terms rather than the names of the tools which carry them out.  For
  example, a test that determines how long it takes for packets to get
  from one host to another should be called {\tt latency} and not {\tt
    owamp}.  A test the determines the same for a round trip should be
  called {\tt rtt} (short for {\it round-trip time}) and not {\tt
    ping}.
\item{\tt description} - A short, textual description of what the test
  measures.
\item{\tt version} - A \jsontype{Version}.
\item{\tt maintainer} - A \jsontype{Maintainer}.
\item{\tt scheduling-class} - A string indicating how runs of this
  kind of test should be scheduled.  Valid values are as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt background} - These tests are run without regard to
    whether anything else is happening.
  \item {\tt background-multi} - These tests are scheduled by the same
    rules as {\tt background}, will run even if the start time has
    passed, and produce multiple results.  (See \autoref{toolrun},
    {\it \nameref{toolrun}} for details on how this is accomplished.)
  \item {\tt exclusive} - Runs are given time on the schedule
    that is not shared with any scheduling class other than {\tt
      background} and {\tt background-multi}.
  \item {\tt normal} - These runs share schedule time with {\tt
    background} and other {\tt normal} runs but not {\tt exclusive}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "name": "rtt",
    "description": "Round-trip time between hosts",
    "version": "1.0",
    "maintainer": {
        "name": "Example Development Team",
        "email": "plug-ins@example.org",
        "href": "http://www.example.org/plug-ins"
    },
    "scheduling-class": "normal"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, nonzero on error.

% TODO: At some point in the future, there will probably be an
% enumeration of what the test itself should look like for use by
% GUIs.


\subsubsection{participants}
This method produces a list of the systems participating in the test
based on the test specification.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A JSON specification of the test.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following
items:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt participants} - An array of the participants, with any {\tt
  null} values indicating the lead participant.  The order of this
  list will match the numbering of participant roles specified in the
  definition of the test.
\item{\tt null-reason} - If the first element of {\tt participants} is
  {\tt null}, a string giving the reason why.
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "participants": [ null, "receivinghost.example.com" ],
    "null-reason": "No source specified"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, nonzero on error.



\subsubsection{spec-is-valid}
This method determines whether not a test specification is valid.

Validation of a parameter should be according to whether or not its
value is usable in a test, not whether or not any of the tools
actually implement it.  For example, a test with a {\tt port}
parameter representing a UDP or TCP port should accept numeric values
in the range {\tt 0} to {\tt 65535} and perhaps strings which can be
translated to port numbers using {\tt getservbyname(3)}.  Tools will
accept or decline individual tests based on their own restrictions.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A JSON test specification.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following
items:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt valid} - A {\tt Boolean} indicating whether or not the input
  was valid.
\item{\tt error} - If {\tt valid} is {\tt false}, a {\tt String}
  describing the problem(s).
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on errors unrelated to the input.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} on success, nonzero on failure
unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{result-is-valid}
This method determines whether or not a result produced by a tool for
this test conforms to the expected format.  \todo{None of the tests so
  far have this.  Not sure there's a need for it.}

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON results for the test as produced by
a tool.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} None.

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if the result was valid, {\tt 1} if
not, {\tt 2} if there was some other problem unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{cli-to-spec}
This method produces a test specification from a set of command-line
switches which, when fed to {\tt spec-to-cli} will produce the same
set of command-line switches.

This method can be invoked as a filter by providing a JSON array of
arguments on the standard input or as a converter by providing the
arguments on the command line.  The set of valid arguments is
test-specific.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} None if arguments are present on the
command line, otherwise a JSON array of strings, each being a
command-line argument.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON specification for the test.

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if the conversion was a success,
            {\tt 1} if not, {\tt 2} if there was some other problem
            unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{spec-to-cli}
This method produces a list of command-line switches from a test
specification which, when fed to {\tt cli-to-spec} will produce the
same specification.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A specification valid for the test.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON array of strings, each having
being a command-line argument suitable for passing to {\tt
  cli-to-spec}.

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if the conversion was a success,
            {\tt 1} if not, {\tt 2} if there was some other problem
            unrelated to the input.


\subsubsection{result-format}
This method converts a JSON result for this test into some other
format, usually intended for human consumption.  Note that
implementations of this method must be able to format output for a
failed test, normally a short ``test failed'' message.

\calloutitem{Arguments} The desired MIME type for the output.  All
implementations must support at least {\tt text/plain} and {\tt
  text/html}.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A JSON object containing the following
elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt spec} - The specification for the test that was run.
\item{\tt result} - The result produced by the run.
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Output} The formatted output.

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} on success, {\tt 1} if not, {\tt 2}
if there was some other problem unrelated to the input.


\subsubsection{specformat}
This method converts a JSON specification for this test into some
other format, usually intended for human consumption.

\calloutitem{Arguments} The desired MIME type for the output.  All
implementations must support at least {\tt text/plain} and {\tt
  text/html}.  If no argument is provided, the default will be {\tt
  text/plain}.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON containing a specification for this
test.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} The formatted output.

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} on success, {\tt 1} if not, {\tt 2}
if there was some other problem unrelated to the input.


\subsubsection{limit-is-valid}
This method validates a limit specification for the test.

\calloutitem{Arguments} None

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON containing the limit specification
to be validated.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following pairs:

\todo{This is duplicated from above; should be part of the JSON
  dictionary.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{valid}{Boolean} An indication of whether or not the
  input was valid.

\item \typeditem{error}{String} if {\tt valid} was \false, a plain
  text message indicating the reason.
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} on success, {\tt 1} if there was a
problem unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{limit-passes}

This method checks to see if a test specification falls within the
restrictions of a limit.

\calloutitem{Arguments} None

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A JSON object containing the following
pairs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{spec}{AnyJSON} The specification of the test parameters.
This must be valid for the current test type.

valid for the current test type.

\end{itemize}


\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following pairs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{passed}{Boolean} An indication of whether or not the
  test was within the limit's constraints.

\item \typeditem{errors}{Array} if {\tt valid} was \false, an array of
  strings containing text messages enumerating the reasons for the
  failure.
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} on success, {\tt 1} if there was a
problem unrelated to the input.



%
% TOOL
%
\subsection{Tool}
\todo{Write this.}

\subsubsection{enumerate}

This method produces a description of the tool in a standard format
used when pScheduler needs to determine what tools are installed.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} Ignored.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} JSON containing the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt name} - A string serving as a short name for the tool.  This
  value should be lowercase and match the name of the directory where
  the tool class is installed.  The name should reflect the software
  used, such as {\tt traceroute}, {\tt tracepath} or {\tt mtr}.
\item{\tt description} - A short, textual description of what the tool
  does.
\item{\tt version} - A \jsontype{Version}.
\item{\tt tests} - An array of strings listing the tests which the
  tool is capable of accommodating.  Including a class here does not
  imply that the tool is required to actually perform the test, only
  that it should be asked if it can perform tests of those listed.
\item{\tt preference} - An integer used to determine the order in
  which tools are selected for tests, with larger numbers indicating
  more oreference.  This allows current, better-supported tools to be
  considered first while still allowing those that are deprecated to
  be used if necessary.  Nominally, the value for most tools should be
  {\tt 0} and deprecated tools should use a negative number.  This
  value is considered advisory only, as some measurements may specify
  that a specific tool be used to conduct a measurement.
\item{\tt maintainer} - A \jsontype{Maintainer}.
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "name": "mtr",
    "description": "Determine network path using MTR",
    "version": "1.0",
    "tests": [ "path" ],
    "preference": 0,
    "maintainer": {
        "name": "Example Development Team",
        "email": "plug-ins@example.org",
        "href": "http://www.example.org/plug-ins"
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, nonzero on error.



\subsubsection{can-run}
This method determines whether or not the tool can run a specified
test.  The test must be in the list of those which the {\tt enumerate}
method lists as being

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A \jsontype{TestSpecification}

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A single JSON object containing the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt can-run} - A \jsontype{Boolean} indicating whether or not
  the tool is willing to run the specified test.
\item{\tt reasons} - If {\tt can-run} is {\tt false}, an array of
  \jsontype{String}, each giving one reason why the test cannot be run
  by this tool.
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if the tool is willing to run the
specified test, nonzero for an error unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{duration}

This method determines how long the tool will require to run the
specified test and how long it should take to produce a result.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A \jsontype{TestSpecification}.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following
items:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt duration} - The amount of time required to set up and
  execute the test, specified as a \jsontype{Duration}.  This value
  should be in whole seconds; any fraction will be increased to the
  next-largest number of seconds (e.g., {\tt PT7.13S} will be
  converted to {\tt PT8S}).
\item{\tt post} - The amount of time expected to produce a result
  after the test has been executed, specified as a
  \jsontype{Duration}.  This value should be in whole seconds; any
  fraction will be increased to the next-largest number of seconds
  (e.g., {\tt PT7.13S} will be converted to {\tt PT8S}).  \note{This
    value is currently ignored but will be used in a later version of
    the software.}
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if determination of the duration was
successful, {\tt 1} if not, {\tt 2} if there was an error related to
the input and {\tt 3} for an error unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{participant-data}

This method returns a tool-specific set of data for a given
participant in a given test.  This data will be gathered centrally and
distributed to all participants, who can use it in carrying out the test.

The canonical use case for this is a tool which requires that one
participant open a port and another connect to it.  Listening
participant 1 would put the port it intends to use in its participant
data.  Connecting participant 0 would use that information in
establishing its connection.


\calloutitem{Standard Input} A JSON object containing the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt test} - A \jsontype{TestSpecification}.

\item{\tt participant} - The number of the participant whose data
  should be generated.  Must be in the range of {\tt 0} to the number
  of participants
\end{itemize}


\calloutitem{Standard Output} An \jsontype{AnyJSON} containing
whatever the tool deems necessary to provide.  If the tool has nothing
to contribute for a given participant, the object should be empty
(i.e., {\tt \{\}}).

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if generation of the participant
data was successful, {\tt 1} if not, {\tt 2} if there was an error
related to the input and {\tt 3} for an error unrelated to the input.



\subsubsection{run}\label{toolrun}
This method carries out the test as one of its participants.

For tests whose scheduling class is {\tt normal} or {\tt exclusive},
the method runs the test, produces the output described below and exits.

When the scheduling class is {\tt background}, the method will produce
multiple results until its time to run (duration) has expired.  Each
result will be JSON in RFC 7464 format (beginning with a ``{\tt RS}''
character and ending with a newline).  It is recommended that programs
implementing this method for background tests use the {\tt
  RFC7464Emitter} class in the pScheduler library and not buffer their
output or make sure to flush it after writing the delimiter.  Once the
run is complete, the method should exit without producing any
additional output.  Errors may be generated in the same way as for
non-background tasks.


\todo{Could use some examples.}

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A JSON run specification containing the following items:
\begin{itemize}

\item{\tt schema} - A \jsontype{Cardinal} indicating the version of the structure

\item{\tt schedule} - A \jsontype{TimeInterval} indicating when the
  task is scheduled to start and how long it should run.  This figure
  includes any additional time added by the tool for startup and
  teardown, so all participants should behave accordingly.

\item{\tt test} - A \jsontype{TestSpecification} describing the test
  being run.

\item{\tt participant} - A \jsontype{Number} indicating which
  participant role in the test is to be played.

\item{\tt participant-data} - A JSON array containing one element of
  tool-specific, per-participant data for the run of the task, as
  generated by the {\tt participant-data} method.

\item{\tt limits-passed} - A JSON array containing a list of objects
  describing limits specific to this test that were passed.  This
  requires that tools implementing limits for unspecified parameters
  (e.g., bandwidth limits for throughput tests) understand the limits
  of the tasks they agree to run.


\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A single JSON object containing the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt succeeded} - A \jsontype{Boolean} indicating whether or not
  the run was a success.

\item{\tt diags} - A free-form \jsontype{String} containing diagnostic
  output.  This is usually populated with raw program output or other
  information the tool finds useful to provide.

\item{\tt error} - A free-form \jsontype{String} containing any errors
  encountered by the tool while running.  This should be {\tt null} or
  empty if the test succeeded.  Non-fatal warnings should be
  incorporated into {\tt diags}.

\item{\tt result} - A JSON object containing test-specific results for
  this participant.

\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if the test ran successfully, {\tt
  1} if there was a test-related error (i.e., the test could run but
was unable to produce results because a remote participant failed to
answer) or {\tt 2} if there was an error unrelated to the test.



\subsubsection{merged-results}

This method takes the results from all participants of a run done with
this tool and prodces a single, merged result in the format specified
by the test being conducted.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} A single JSON object containing the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\tt test} - A \jsontype{TestSpecification} describing the test
  that was run.

\item{\tt results} - A JSON array containing one test result for each
  participant in the test.  Each is any valid JSON object and the
  format is tool-specific.

\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A single JSON object representing the
result.  This object must contain at least the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\tt succeeded} - A \jsontype{Boolean} indicating whether the
  test was a success or failure.

\end{itemize}


\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if generation of the merged result
was successful, {\tt 1} if there was an error related to the input or
{\tt 2} if there was an error unrelated to the input.

% CONTEXT
%
\subsection{Context}

Context plugins alter the execution context of tools before they are
run.  This is accomplished using {\it exec chaining}, where the
plugins replace themselves with other programs via the system's {\tt
  exec*(3)} family of calls instead of exiting.

At this writing, the only known application for this type of
plugin is changing network namespaces on Linux systems.

\subsubsection{enumerate}

This method produces a description of the context changer in a
standard format used when pScheduler needs to determine what tools are
installed.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} Ignored.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} JSON containing the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt name} - A string serving as a short name for the plugin.
  This value should be lowercase and match the name of the directory
  where the tool class is installed.  The name should reflect its
  function, such as {\tt linuxnns} or {\tt null}.
\item{\tt description} - A short, textual description of what the
  context changer does.
\item{\tt version} - A \jsontype{Version}.
\item{\tt maintainer} - A \jsontype{Maintainer}.
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "name": "kafooble",
    "description": "Change the kafoobling factor",
    "version": "1.0",
    "maintainer": {
        "name": "Example Development Team",
        "email": "plug-ins@example.org",
        "href": "http://www.example.org/plug-ins"
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, nonzero on error.


\subsubsection{data-is-valid}

This method determines whether or not provided data is valid for use
by the context changer.  Note that this checks the data for validity
only and not for whether or not the data will result in the context
being successfully changed.  It should not do anything that could be
long-running or may be intermittent such as performing DNS lookups or
determining if a web server answers.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON containing the {\tt data} element of
an \jsontype{ContextSpecificationSingle}.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following pairs:

\todo{This gets used in multiple places and should be brought into the
  JSON dictionary.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{valid}{Boolean} An indication of whether or not the
  input was valid.

\item \typeditem{error}{String} if {\tt valid} was \false, a plain
  text message indicating the reason.
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages describing any errors other than the data being invald.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, {\tt 1} if there was
any error unrelated to the input.


\subsubsection{change}

This method effects the context change and then executes another
program specified by the input.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON containing the following pairs:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt data} - The data to be used by the plug-in.  This is assumed
  to have been validated by the {\tt data-is-valid} method.
\item{\tt exec} - A \jsontype{String} naming the path of the program
  to be executed when this one finishes successfully.  This program
  {\em must} be invoked using one of the {\tt exec*(3)} family of
  calls.
\end{itemize}

\calloutitem{Standard Output} None.

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages describing any errors other than the data being invald.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} If successful, the method should not exit
(see {\tt exec}, above).  The method should exit {\tt 1} if there was
any error.

% ARCHIVER
%
\subsection{Archiver}
Archivers are plug-ins which transfer the results of a run to
long-term storage.

\todo{Flesh this out.}

\todo{Add note about supporting a {\tt bind} option for archivers that
  use the network}


\subsubsection{enumerate}

This method produces a description of the archiver in a standard
format used when pScheduler needs to determine what archivers are
installed.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} Ignored.

\calloutitem{Standard Output} JSON containing the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt name} - A string serving as a short name for the archiver.
  This value should be lowercase and match the name of the directory
  where the archiver implementation is installed.  Archiver names
  should reflect the destination, such as {\tt bitbucket} for a data
  sink or {\tt esmond} for an archiving system like {\it esmond}.
\item{\tt description} - A short, textual description of what the
  archiver does.
\item{\tt version} - A \jsontype{Version}.
\item{\tt maintainer} - A \jsontype{Maintainer}.
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "name": "bitbucket",
    "description": "Dump results into the bit bucket.",
    "version": "1.0",

    "maintainer": {
        "name": "perfSONAR Development Team",
        "email": "info@perfsonar.net",
        "href": "http://www.perfsonar.net"
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages on error.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, nonzero on error.



\subsubsection{data-is-valid}

This method determines whether or not provided data is valid for use
by the archiver.  Note that this checks the data for validity only and
not for whether or not the data will result in the archiving being
successful.  It should not do anything that could be long-running or
may be intermittent such as performing DNS lookups or determining if a
web server answers.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON containing the {\tt data} element of
an \jsontype{ArchiveSpecification}.  If the archive specification
contained no {\tt data} element, the standard input will be an empty
JSON object (i.e., {\tt \{ \}}).

\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object containing the following pairs:

\todo{This gets used in multiple places and should be brought into the
  JSON dictionary.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{valid}{Boolean} An indication of whether or not the
  input was valid.

\item \typeditem{error}{String} if {\tt valid} was \false, a plain
  text message indicating the reason.
\end{itemize}


\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages describing any errors other than the data being invald.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, {\tt 1} if there was
any error unrelated to the input.


\subsubsection{archive}

This method sends the results of a run to the archiver.

\calloutitem{Standard Input} JSON containing the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{data}{AnyJSON} Archiver-specific information on how to proceed.

\item \typeditem{task-href}{URL} The URI for the task that produced
  this result.

\item \typeditem{run-href}{URL} The URI for the run that produced
  this result.

\item\typeditem{participants}{Array}: An array of {\tt String} items
  listing the nodes that participated in the test.

\item \typeditem{result}{RunResult} A {\tt RunResult} describing
  the results of the run.

\item \typeditem{attempts}{Cardinal} The number of prior, unsuccessful
  attempts to archive the run.

\item \typeditem{last-attempt}{Timestamp} The time of the last attempt
  to archive the run.  This will be {\tt null} if there have been no
  prior attempts.
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "data": { ...Archiver-Specific Data... },
    "participants": [ "host1", "host2" ],
    "task": { ...Task specification... },
    "result": { ...Results of run... },
    "attempts": 2,
    "last-attempt": "2016-05-07T13:05:27"
}
\end{lstlisting}


\calloutitem{Standard Output} A JSON object with information on how
the attempt to archive the run went, containing the following pairs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \typeditem{succeeded}{Boolean} Whether or not the attempt to archive
the run succeeded.
\item \typeditem{error}{String} An optional explanation of why the
  attempt to archive the run did not succeed.
\item \typeditem{retry}{Duration} The minimum amount of time that
  should elapse before the next attempt.  Not provided if {\tt
    succeeded} is \true\  or no further attempts should be made to
  archive the run.
\end{itemize}

\example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
{
    "succeeded": false,
    "error": "Unable to connect: Unknown host 'badhost'",
    "retry": "PT15M"
}
\end{lstlisting}


\calloutitem{Standard Error} Empty if successful, plain text error
messages describing any problem unrelated to the input.

\calloutitem{Exit Status} {\tt 0} if successful, {\tt 1} if there was
an error.  Note that in this context, an error means a problem running
the method and not with the archiving process.

\part{Building Plug-Ins}

\section{Implementation}
\todo{Write this.}

\section{Packaging}

\subsection{Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Fedora}
\todo{Write this.}

The RPM specs for the {\tt pscheduler-archiver-bitbucket}, {\tt
  pscheduler-test-idle} and {\tt pscheduler-tool-sleep} packages are
recommended to be used as templates for new development.

With {\tt pscheduler-rpm} installed on the system, the following
macros are available for use in RPM specifications:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll} 
    % Tests
    {\tt _pscheduler_test_libexec} & Test implementations \\
    {\tt _pscheduler_test_doc} & Test documentation \\
    % Tools
    {\tt _pscheduler_tool_libexec} & Tool implementations \\
    {\tt _pscheduler_tool_doc} & Tool documentation \\
    % Archivers
    {\tt _pscheduler_archiver_libexec} & Archiver implementations \\
    {\tt _pscheduler_archiver_doc} & Archiver documentation \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Test, tool and archiver implementations should be installed in a
subdirectory matching their names.  For example,
{\tt\%\{_pscheduler_tool_libexec\}/owamp} would be the recommended
way to specify the installation directory for the {\tt owamp} tool.

\subsection{Debian}
\todo{Write this after Antoine has had a chance to package a few
  things.}

\subsection{OS X}
\todo{Do we want to support OS X?  Nothing in pScheduler should be
  Linux-specific.  Some tools may need to understand what environment
  they're running in when invoking test programs because command line
  switches or other things may be different (e.g., With {\tt ping(8)},
  the switch to change TOS is {\tt -Q} where OS X uses {\tt -z}).
  This will either need to be accommodated by making the tools smart
  enough to detect and handle the differences or having multiple
  versions.  Either way, there may be a need for a list of supported
  OS names to be in the enumeration.  (Use the output of {\tt uname
    -s} for this.)}
