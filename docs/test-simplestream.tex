% INTRODUCTION

\section{Introduction}

The {\tt \testname} test establishes a TCP connection between two
participants (a {\it sender} and a {\it receiver}), sends some test
data and then closes the connection.  This test is intended for use in
development and testing and not for use in producion.

This document describes schema version {\tt 1}.

\subsection{Participants}

This test includes the following participants:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Number} & {\bf Role} \\
\hline
{\tt 0} & Sender \\
{\tt 1} & Receiver \\

% TEST SPECIFICATION
%

\section{Test Specification Format}

\subsection{Description}

The test specification consists of a single JSON object containing the
pairs below.  \seejson

\typeditem{schema}{Cardinal} The schema version of this specification.

\typeditem{dest}{Host} The network address or hostname of the receiver.

\typeditem{dawdle}{Duration} Optional maximum amount of time the sender
may intentionally wait between the start of the test and establishing
the connection to the receiver.  This value must be less than {\tt
timeout}.  If not provided, the sender should begin the test
immediately.  Tools implementing this test may select a random
duration between {\tt P0} and this value.

\typeditem{source}{Host} The network address or hostname of the sender.

\typeditem{test-material}{String} Optional text to be sent across the
connection.  If not provided, the sender may send any data it chooses.

\typeditem{timeout}{Duration} The amount of time the receiver will wait
before declaring the test a failure.  The default will be determined
by the tool executing the test.

\typeditem{fail}{Probablity} The probability that either participant
will abort with a forced error.  The default value is {\tt 0}.  This
should be used for test and debug only.

% RESULT FORMAT

\section{Result Format}

\subsection{Description}
The result consists of a single JSON object containing the pairs
below.  \seejson

\typeditem{schema}{Cardinal} The schema version of the result.

\typeditem{dawdled}{Duration} The time the sender spend dawdling
before opening the connection.

\typeditem{elapsed-time}{Duration} The time elapsed between the start
of the test and when the sender closed the connection, as measured by
the receiver.

\typeditem{succeeded}{Boolean} Whether or not the test was successful.

\typeditem{dawdled}{Duration} How long the sender dawdled before
connecting to the receiver.

\typeditem{sent}{String} The test material sent by the sender.

\typeditem{received}{String} The test material received by the receiver.

\typeditem{elapsed-time}{Duration} The amount of time that elapsed between
the time the reciever started listening for a connection and the
