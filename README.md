# pScheduler - The perfSONAR Scheduler


## NOTICE

This software is under development and is nowhere near ready for
actual use.

## Building pScheduler

Documentation on building pScheuler is in the Developer's Guide, which
can be found in the docs directory.  This directory is not currently
part of the build proces and must be built manually.

There's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem (TODO: fix this), so you'll
need a system with LaTeX to build the manual.

1. Install LaTex (TODO: Which package(s), specifically?)
2. `cd docs`
3. `make`

This will produce PDFs of all documents.
