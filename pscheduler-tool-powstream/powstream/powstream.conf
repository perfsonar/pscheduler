# by the pscheduler tool to publish result. Default is /var/lib/pscheduler/tool/powstream

# Otherwise they are removed as soon as pScheduler processes them. The default behavior is
# to remove them. If they are not removed they can use considerable disk space over time.
# This should only be used for advanced application that want the ability to access the raw 
# files on disk.
#
# NOTE: If data_dir, above, is not set, pScheduler's automatic cleanup
# of its temporary space will results in files being removed.
