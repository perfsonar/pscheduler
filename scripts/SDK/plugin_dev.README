### pScheduler Plugin Development Guide ###

# 1. Create desired test/tool/archiver directories using the plugin_dev.py
script.

Usage: plugin_dev [test|archiver] [name]
       plugin_dev [tool] [test-associated] [name]

# 2. First, go to the tool directory and open the files 'can-run' and
'enumerate'. There are fields in each file marked 'EDIT ME', which should
be changed to match the name of the test you just created. These files
should also be commented with instruction.

# 3. In the root directory of the test and the tool, run 'sudo make cbic'.
Having done this, a basic idling plugin will have been built into pSschduler.
Run 'pscheduler task [name] --help' to see its usage case. Running 
'pscheduler plugins [tests|tools]' should show the new plugin in the list
of tests/tools.

# 4. Now, start in the root of the test directory and run 'grep -R Order *'.
According to the order number of the files, each one should then be
visited and changed, if deemed necessary. Each one will be commented
at the top, as well as throughout.

# 5. Do the same with the tool, running 'grep -R Order *' in its root
directory to start.

### Notes ###

- Any time you wish to test the plugin through pScheduler itself, just
run 'make cbic' in the test and tool root directories to rebuild. If you're
getting unusual behavior, sometimes rebuildling pScheduler itself can be
helpful.

- It is recommened that you first test several of the files by directly
piping json into them. It's much more convenient than rebuilding into
pScheduler, and will be easier to immediately diagnose.
For example, ./cli-to-spec --arg options | ./spec-format

- To see the run results of a pScheduler run, run 'curl -s -k'
on the Task URL. This will be output in JSON, which can be piped into
a file or into something like JQ for readability
