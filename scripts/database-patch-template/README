This directory contains a Makefile for building and installing
temporary patches to the pScheduler database.

To build a patch:

1.  Place whatever SQL files are involved in the patch in this directory.

2.  Edit the Makefile and adjust the configurable items as required.
    In almost all case, only NAME and SQL_FILES should be changed.

3.  Install the patch by doing a 'make install' on a system
    (prefereably one that's expendable) with pScheduler installed.

4.  Test.

5.  Build a distributable tarball by doing a 'make tar'.
