This directory contains support for multiple flavors of Debian and
Ubuntu, set up using the Makefile.  That build is triggered in the
top-level Makefile for the package (../../Makefile).

Files generated are in .gitignore so they don't slip into  version
control.

There is a specially crafted metapackage that  is  added  to  what
should be the master build OS control file. This metapackage takes
care of creating a dependency  list  to  get  the  correct  binary
package for each distribution we support. It only needs  to  exist
in one of the control files.

U20 and D11 builds are called plain iperf3 as they are linked
with libssl (>1.1)

U22, U24 and D12 builds are called iperf3-ssl3 as they are linked
with libssl3 (>3.0)
