Description: Internet Protocol bandwidth measuring tool
 Iperf is a modern alternative for measuring TCP and UDP bandwidth performance,
 allowing the tuning of various parameters and characteristics.
 .
 Features:
    * Measure bandwidth, packet loss, delay jitter
    * Report MSS/MTU size and observed read sizes.
    * Support for TCP window size via socket buffers.
    * Multi-threaded. Client and server can have multiple simultaneous
      connections.
    * Client can create UDP streams of specified bandwidth.
    * Multicast and IPv6 capable.
    * Options can be specified with K (kilo-) and M (mega-) suffices.
    * Can run for specified time, rather than a set amount of data to transfer.
    * Picks the best units for the size of data being reported.
    * Server handles multiple connections.
    * Print periodic, intermediate bandwidth, jitter, and loss reports at
      specified intervals.
    * Server can be run as a daemon.
    * Use representative streams to test out how link layer compression affects
      your achievable bandwidth.
