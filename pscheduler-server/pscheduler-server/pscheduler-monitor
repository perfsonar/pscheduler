# Monitor the state of pScheduler's schedule.
#
# Usage:  pscheduler-monitor [ --sleep n ]
#
# Where:
#     --sleep n   Sleeps for n seconds between checks.  The default
#                 is 2.
#     --uuid      Show task/run UUIDs instead of DB row IDs
#
#
# NOTE: This program is not particularly resource-efficient and should
# really only be used for debug and diagnostics.
# TODO: Write a better version of this in Python with curses.
# TODO: Need to handle reading the DSN file.
